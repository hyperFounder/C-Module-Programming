## C is a general-purpose computer programming language. 

- It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. 
- By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.


### History


In 1972, a group of computer scientists at Bell Labs was tasked to create a programming language to craft utilities for the Unix OS. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created C to overcome portability issues from the B language. More than 49 years later, C remained at the top-tier programming language for more than 20 years. The power of C comes from its effective mapping to assembly and low-level control.


- It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at the AT&T Bell Laboratories. It was developed along with the UNIX operating system, and is strongly linked with UNIX operating system.
- The development of C was intended to serve as the foundation for the creation of UNIX.


### GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)


The GNU Compiler Collection, commonly known as GCC, is a set of compilers and development tools available for Linux, Windows, various BSDs, and a wide assortment of other operating systems. It includes support primarily for C and C++ and includes Objective-C, Ada, Go, Fortran, and D. 

- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) wrote GCC and released it as completely free (as in libre) software.


### Applications of C Programming:


- C can be used to design browsers.
- As mentioned earlier C is strongly linked with UNIX Operating System. So, C can be used to design an operating System.
- C language can be used to develop smartphone games as well.
- Worthwhile to mention, C can be used to design a database. Many of the databases are based on C like Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server.
